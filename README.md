My Find Movies React project based on themoviedbs free API. Search or sort by, get a small information card with links to trailer and more info.

I always wanted to make a fun and good looking movie website. But the main gaol was to practice more api handling, and get the different routes to work.
Aswell getting alot of CSS practice making the cards.

Made with React, HTML, CSS and JS.
